                        Viper scans your work against over 10 billion web pages and work previously 
                        submitted to our firm. Once the scan is completed, the report delivers content 
                        that may match these other sources, including links to the sites that contain 
                        the same content.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        <b class="red-text">What Do the Results Mean?</b><br />
                        If the report sends back positive matches to content found elsewhere, there is no need to panic and assume you have plagiarised your work. Instead, review the report carefully and consider the following:
                       
                        <ul>
                        <li>
                        Is the material an entire quote, a sentence, or a fragment of 4-5 words often found together? Viper will show a match where there is a string of five or more 
                        words that are the same as your work. Even if this is not actually plagiarism, it is important that Viper does not ignore these fragments as they draw your 
                        attention to any sentences where the writer has &#39;rephrased&#39; parts of the 
                        original material without referencing the source.
                        </li> 
                            
                        <li>If it was intended to be a quote that you were going to attribute to the source, 
                            did you remember to properly reference it? Sometimes, Viper will identify 
                            matching material that is available on websites, but the reference might have 
                            been found within another source. Just because the work has content that matches 
                            a particular website does not mean that every possible source where it appears 
                            has to be referenced. Just make sure that at least one reference covers that 
                        content.
						</li>
                        <li>Did you actually use a footnote and it was just simply not picked up by Viper? 
                            This review is just a means of double-checking that all references have been 
                            included.
						</li>
                        <li>Could Viper have just picked up a phrase that you used more than once in your 
                            document? This may be a way to ensure that your writing is tight rather than 
                            repetitive or relies on overly used phrases.
						</li>    
                        <li>Did you use too many direct quotes? Viper checks for direct quotes and delivers 
                            an overall percentage of words it views as direct quotes. Clearly, this should 
                            not be too high as work that relies too heavily on other material is not 
                            &#39;original&#39;.
						</li>
                        </ul>
                            <b class="red-text">A Guide on Viper Results</b>
                            <br/>This guide explains how Viper can identify matching content when it scans your work:
                            <br/>
                            <br/><b class="red-text">Overall plagiarism rating 6% or less : </b>
                            <br/>The results are that it is highly unlikely that this document contains plagiarised material. A careful check will only be necessary if this is a lengthy document. For example, a 6% result within a 15,000 word essay would be of concern because it could mean that direct quotes are too lengthy or there are too many places where a reference was not listed.<br/>
                            <br/><b class="red-text">Overall plagiarism rating 6% - 12% : </b>
                            <br/>The results are that there is a low risk that the document contains any plagiarised material. Most of the matching content will probably be fragments. Review your report for any sections that may not have been referenced properly.<br/>
                            <br/><b class="red-text">Overall plagiarism rating 13% - 20% : </b>
                            <br/>The results are that there is a medium risk that the document contains any plagiarised material. There may be sections that match websites so it is important to check that proper credit was attributed to the other sources. The scan may not have detected quotation marks or footnotes that were used. For example, if an opening quotation mark was included but there was not a closing quotation mark, then this could explain the higher result. <br/>
                            <br/><b class="red-text">Overall plagiarism rating 21%+ : </b>
                            <br/>The results are that there is a high risk that the document contains plagiarised material. If the overall rating is this high, you need to check your report very carefully. It may be that there are a lot of matching fragments and the software has not identified all direct quotes , but it is critical that you go through the entire document and address every phrase or fragment that the scan has flagged to reduce this percentage.<br/>

                        <p> LITERATURE REVIEW3.1 Advanced PreliminaryThe idea of this project ignited in developers mind once when in college there was sport week where announce<br /> an the developer take the participate in cricket and the cricket match was in mulund city in Mumbai, Maharashtra ,the developer wake up early in the<br /> morning and get ready to go to mulund via railway station. When he reach to the destination he keep the mobile in the bag because while playing<br /> cricket the mobile can fall down and can be damage .when the match start developer was playing an cricket and that time one boy come and take my<br /> mobile from the bag an run away. After finish the match in one hour when developer check the bag an find the mobile was not there in the bag, I ask<br /> the friends about the mobile and asked to sir but no one noes about the mobile. After next day's developer go to the police station and make an FIR<br /> of misplaced mobile after make it they told me that they will call me when they will found the mobile. After 3 months they call me and I got<br /> mobile back poor condition. Therefore the idea for development and implementation of such project struck into developer's mind which can be<br /> multipurpose for eradicating crime.Developer knew some few thing before making the project:1. Google- Maps  The developer knew that the best and most<br /> accurate procedure to find any place is Google-Map, a service which is known to everybody, so inclusion of this in project won't need an extra<br /> training of users to make them understand the procedure of finding a place. </w:t><br /> 
                        System (GPS) trackingThe developer knew that the most accurate procedure to find the exact location of a place is by only GPS and if he could attach<br /> GPS with Google-Map then the users can find the exact location of anyone and as     these devices are on everybody's android mobile.<br /> MAP WITH GPS COORDINATES (GOOGLE TEAM, 1995)3.2SecondaryResearch First phase of any software development model involves research and analysis method<br /> to find specific data regarding any project. Developer has categorized them under specific categories based on their use during development of<br /> project.3.3 Domain Research Domain research is required as project domains vary in various cases and once domain research is accomplished in<br /> particular module, then analysis and designing of particular module provides ease of its use.3 Mobile Development Life Cycle: Mobile application<br /> lifecycle management will be followed and few more facts are known like<a href='http://g8appz.wordpress.com/2014/02/10/believe-mobile-do-mobile-earn-mobile-18/' class="matched-text" title='http://g8appz.wordpress.com/2014/02/10/believe-mobile-do-mobile-earn-mobile-18/' target='_blank'> the diagnostic approach is very challenging due to the diversity of devices<br /></a><a href='http://g8appz.wordpress.com/2014/02/10/believe-mobile-do-mobile-earn-mobile-18/' class="matched-text" title='http://g8appz.wordpress.com/2014/02/10/believe-mobile-do-mobile-earn-mobile-18/' target='_blank'> Mobile app performance is not mature to have end-to-end or front-end monitoring yet and Mobile app</a> development<a href='http://g8appz.wordpress.com/2014/02/10/believe-mobile-do-mobile-earn-mobile-18/' class="matched-text" title='http://g8appz.wordpress.com/2014/02/10/believe-mobile-do-mobile-earn-mobile-18/' target='_blank'> requires in-depth network (e.g<br /> bandwidth optimization in codes, bandwidth simulation) and mobile deployment knowledge.</a> (Amla harshim ,monkieblankie, 2006 )3.2.1.4<br /> Client-Server Communication (Mobile Application will upload data to server)The proposed system will use Client-Server architecture to store the data<br /> in the database of server so that separate copies of the item are not stored on each client3.2.1.5 Real-time Location gathering: For absolute<br /> location of data various location gathering technique is studied-Wi-Fi Location accessed via Wi-Fi is accurate to the cellular provider network<br /> towers and generally the towers provide the signals up to 50-60 km, so the location accuracy is anywhere from 50-60 Km which doesn't fulfill<br /> purpose.</w:t><Conclusion: The proposed system will not access the location of users by Wi-Fi, as this is less accurate than GPS location providers<br /> GPS:<a href='http://searchmobilecomputing.techtarget.com/definition/Global-Positioning-System' class="matched-text" title='http://searchmobilecomputing.techtarget.com/definition/Global-Positioning-System' target='_blank'> The GPS (Global Positioning System) is a "constellation" of 24 well-spaced satellites that orbit the Earth and make it possible for people with<br /> ground receivers to pinpoint their geographic location.</a><a href='http://searchmobilecomputing.techtarget.com/definition/Global-Positioning-System' class="matched-text" title='http://searchmobilecomputing.techtarget.com/definition/Global-Positioning-System' target='_blank'> GPS equipment is widely used in science and has now become sufficiently low-cost so that<br /> almost anyone can own a GPS receiver</a> (Moshe Peleg, 2009) Conclusion: The system will access the location of users by GPS location<br /> Available ResourcesBook Name Book Detail Learning AndroidPublisher O'Reilly, Author Marko Gargenta Year 2011, Pages 292Professional Android Sensor<br /> ProgrammingPublisher:Wroxm, By:Greg Milette, Adam Stroud year 2013,  pages 552Table 11: Avalible ResourceWEBSITE S.no LINK1Google Android Team<br /> The Android SDK.
