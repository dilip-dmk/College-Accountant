                        Viper scans your work against over 10 billion web pages and work previously 
                        submitted to our firm. Once the scan is completed, the report delivers content 
                        that may match these other sources, including links to the sites that contain 
                        the same content.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        <b class="red-text">What Do the Results Mean?</b><br />
                        If the report sends back positive matches to content found elsewhere, there is no need to panic and assume you have plagiarised your work. Instead, review the report carefully and consider the following:
                       
                        <ul>
                        <li>
                        Is the material an entire quote, a sentence, or a fragment of 4-5 words often found together? Viper will show a match where there is a string of five or more 
                        words that are the same as your work. Even if this is not actually plagiarism, it is important that Viper does not ignore these fragments as they draw your 
                        attention to any sentences where the writer has &#39;rephrased&#39; parts of the 
                        original material without referencing the source.
                        </li> 
                            
                        <li>If it was intended to be a quote that you were going to attribute to the source, 
                            did you remember to properly reference it? Sometimes, Viper will identify 
                            matching material that is available on websites, but the reference might have 
                            been found within another source. Just because the work has content that matches 
                            a particular website does not mean that every possible source where it appears 
                            has to be referenced. Just make sure that at least one reference covers that 
                        content.
						</li>
                        <li>Did you actually use a footnote and it was just simply not picked up by Viper? 
                            This review is just a means of double-checking that all references have been 
                            included.
						</li>
                        <li>Could Viper have just picked up a phrase that you used more than once in your 
                            document? This may be a way to ensure that your writing is tight rather than 
                            repetitive or relies on overly used phrases.
						</li>    
                        <li>Did you use too many direct quotes? Viper checks for direct quotes and delivers 
                            an overall percentage of words it views as direct quotes. Clearly, this should 
                            not be too high as work that relies too heavily on other material is not 
                            &#39;original&#39;.
						</li>
                        </ul>
                            <b class="red-text">A Guide on Viper Results</b>
                            <br/>This guide explains how Viper can identify matching content when it scans your work:
                            <br/>
                            <br/><b class="red-text">Overall plagiarism rating 6% or less : </b>
                            <br/>The results are that it is highly unlikely that this document contains plagiarised material. A careful check will only be necessary if this is a lengthy document. For example, a 6% result within a 15,000 word essay would be of concern because it could mean that direct quotes are too lengthy or there are too many places where a reference was not listed.<br/>
                            <br/><b class="red-text">Overall plagiarism rating 6% - 12% : </b>
                            <br/>The results are that there is a low risk that the document contains any plagiarised material. Most of the matching content will probably be fragments. Review your report for any sections that may not have been referenced properly.<br/>
                            <br/><b class="red-text">Overall plagiarism rating 13% - 20% : </b>
                            <br/>The results are that there is a medium risk that the document contains any plagiarised material. There may be sections that match websites so it is important to check that proper credit was attributed to the other sources. The scan may not have detected quotation marks or footnotes that were used. For example, if an opening quotation mark was included but there was not a closing quotation mark, then this could explain the higher result. <br/>
                            <br/><b class="red-text">Overall plagiarism rating 21%+ : </b>
                            <br/>The results are that there is a high risk that the document contains plagiarised material. If the overall rating is this high, you need to check your report very carefully. It may be that there are a lot of matching fragments and the software has not identified all direct quotes , but it is critical that you go through the entire document and address every phrase or fragment that the scan has flagged to reduce this percentage.<br/>

Implementation is one of the important and biggest part of the system developed life cycle and it involves code the system using programming language (android with SQLite) and use the technology to implement the system and transfer the design into actual working system, which takes lot of effort and time.7.1.1 Tools Used for ImplementationNOCase tool/development tool  other Purpose 1Microsoft Visio 2013To draw all the UML diagrams, activity, sequence, use case.2Microsoft Project 2013To draw Gantt chart 3Adtbundle windows To implement the functionality 4Microsoft Word 2013To document the report.5Microsoft PowerPoint 2013To prepare for presentation 7Microsoft visual studio To develop website 8Microsoft SQL server To develop database Table 29:Case tool in table7.1.2 Implementation approachTo accomplish this task developer assigned a priority to each and every module. The system which is of higher priority should be developed first7.1.2.1 Approach description Module Priority  Approach User module 1First developer need to start the registration  functionality :so that user can be authenticate 2After registration ,developer need to make login module 3After making this two main module developer need to make all functionality related to user User module (web base) 1First developer need to start the registration  functionality :so that user can be authenticate 2After making this two main module developer need to make all functionality related to user  </Table 30:Approach description7.1.3 Pseudo codeStep 1: user must register before login in the application   Pseudo code for registration</:Functionally Pseudo code Registration Step 1:STARTStep2:Get detail from the userStep 3:if check validation of data             input by the user is valid Step 3.1:pass data to the server Step 3.2:server insert the data in      table Step 3.3: message register successfully Step4:else Step 4.1:message register unsuccessful Table 31:   Pseudo code for registrationFunctionally Pseudo code loginStep -1: START Step- 2: Get Input details from user Step- 3: Check details  in valid format  Step-4:Pass data to the server Step-5: Server receives the data Step-6 IF  details in data is valid THEN Step-6.1:Redirect to my account page  Step 7: END IF Step-10 END  Table 32: Pseudo </code for loginObjectiveLogin is based on authentication details which are provided, for operators after their registration administrator can mail emailid /password.
