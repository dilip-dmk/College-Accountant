                        Viper scans your work against over 10 billion web pages and work previously 
                        submitted to our firm. Once the scan is completed, the report delivers content 
                        that may match these other sources, including links to the sites that contain 
                        the same content.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        <b class="red-text">What Do the Results Mean?</b><br />
                        If the report sends back positive matches to content found elsewhere, there is no need to panic and assume you have plagiarised your work. Instead, review the report carefully and consider the following:
                       
                        <ul>
                        <li>
                        Is the material an entire quote, a sentence, or a fragment of 4-5 words often found together? Viper will show a match where there is a string of five or more 
                        words that are the same as your work. Even if this is not actually plagiarism, it is important that Viper does not ignore these fragments as they draw your 
                        attention to any sentences where the writer has &#39;rephrased&#39; parts of the 
                        original material without referencing the source.
                        </li> 
                            
                        <li>If it was intended to be a quote that you were going to attribute to the source, 
                            did you remember to properly reference it? Sometimes, Viper will identify 
                            matching material that is available on websites, but the reference might have 
                            been found within another source. Just because the work has content that matches 
                            a particular website does not mean that every possible source where it appears 
                            has to be referenced. Just make sure that at least one reference covers that 
                        content.
						</li>
                        <li>Did you actually use a footnote and it was just simply not picked up by Viper? 
                            This review is just a means of double-checking that all references have been 
                            included.
						</li>
                        <li>Could Viper have just picked up a phrase that you used more than once in your 
                            document? This may be a way to ensure that your writing is tight rather than 
                            repetitive or relies on overly used phrases.
						</li>    
                        <li>Did you use too many direct quotes? Viper checks for direct quotes and delivers 
                            an overall percentage of words it views as direct quotes. Clearly, this should 
                            not be too high as work that relies too heavily on other material is not 
                            &#39;original&#39;.
						</li>
                        </ul>
                            <b class="red-text">A Guide on Viper Results</b>
                            <br/>This guide explains how Viper can identify matching content when it scans your work:
                            <br/>
                            <br/><b class="red-text">Overall plagiarism rating 6% or less : </b>
                            <br/>The results are that it is highly unlikely that this document contains plagiarised material. A careful check will only be necessary if this is a lengthy document. For example, a 6% result within a 15,000 word essay would be of concern because it could mean that direct quotes are too lengthy or there are too many places where a reference was not listed.<br/>
                            <br/><b class="red-text">Overall plagiarism rating 6% - 12% : </b>
                            <br/>The results are that there is a low risk that the document contains any plagiarised material. Most of the matching content will probably be fragments. Review your report for any sections that may not have been referenced properly.<br/>
                            <br/><b class="red-text">Overall plagiarism rating 13% - 20% : </b>
                            <br/>The results are that there is a medium risk that the document contains any plagiarised material. There may be sections that match websites so it is important to check that proper credit was attributed to the other sources. The scan may not have detected quotation marks or footnotes that were used. For example, if an opening quotation mark was included but there was not a closing quotation mark, then this could explain the higher result. <br/>
                            <br/><b class="red-text">Overall plagiarism rating 21%+ : </b>
                            <br/>The results are that there is a high risk that the document contains plagiarised material. If the overall rating is this high, you need to check your report very carefully. It may be that there are a lot of matching fragments and the software has not identified all direct quotes , but it is critical that you go through the entire document and address every phrase or fragment that the scan has flagged to reduce this percentage.<br/>
